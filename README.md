# Talpa
Talpa ("mole" in Latin), by (Arty Sandler)[http://www.iggamecenter.com/info/en/about.html] (a.k.a. Artyom Tchebotaryov), is a member of the connection game family.

## Setup
Talpa is played on an 8x8 board. The inner smaller board (6x6) can also be used by beginners or for quick games.

Initially the board is filled with X's and O's pieces arranged in the checkerboard pattern. Each player has an allocated symbol (X or O).

## Rules
Players move alternately, starting with the player controlling the X's pieces.

A player moves by picking up one of his pieces and capturing an opponent's piece on an horizontally or vertically adjacent square. The captured piece is removed from the board and the capturing piece moves to its square. The capture is mandatory if possible. When capturing becomes impossible, players remove one of their stones per turn. 

#### Goal
The goal of Talpa is to open a path of orthogonally connected empty spaces linking the opposite edges of the board (vertically for X and horizontally for O) without opening a similar path between your opponent's edges.

A player loses the game immediately if he makes a move that opens the path of empty spaces between the opponent's edges even if this move opens the path between his own edges the same time.

A corner is considered to be part of both adjoining edges.

No draws are possible.
